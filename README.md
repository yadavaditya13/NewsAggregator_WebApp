# NewsAggregator_WebApp

This project is created in Django and it has two concepts:
1) Web Scraping and 2) Web Application

We scrape data from TOI, NDTV and HT sites and display them at one spot our very own WebApp. We also save the data (img, url, title and content) in database and then display it from there.
